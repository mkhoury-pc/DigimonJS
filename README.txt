Welcome to my Digimon Card Game Search Tool App!

This App features the following:

1.  A search bar that takes in a DIGIMON name.  On the click of the submit button the app fetches the DIGIMON API and 
displays the image of the searched card.

2.  An active countdown to the release date of the expansion set "Battle of Omni".

3.  A deck card counting tool that allows you to enter your number of DIGITAMA and DIGIMON cards and when the submit 
button is clicked an amount is displayed letting the user know how many cards to add/subtract from their deck to be 
tournament ready.
